# World Bosses

World Bosses are **extremely** strong non-player opponents that require the teamwork of multiple players to defeat. They spawn every Monday at 12 PM London Time (GMT+1) and have a timer reflecting when they will be attackable.

12 normal world bosses and 1 god world boss are generated every week. A god gives you 3 times the rewards and a 3 times higher chance of finding a celestial or exotic.

In order to qualify for the experience and items of the Boss, you will need to hit the Boss at least twice - once before its death and once after. If you help defeat a World Boss, you get experience equivalent to 8x, 12x, or 16x your current level and a minimum of a rare item. It is possible to get a celestial from a World Boss.

Bosses can be attacked by players as long as they have 5% health left.

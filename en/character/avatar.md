## Introduction
Avatars are items which can be equipped as your character in game. Avatar items can drop from stepping, PvP, PvE, chests and world boss and can range from legendary to exotic [rarity][1]. Avatars drop as items in your inventory, where they can be collected and permanently bound to your collection. 

Upon creating an account, the user is able to choose from a list of default avatars. During events, avatars may be available as an item in the Event Store. Custom Avatars may be purchased and uploaded through the Diamond Store.


Avatars can be changed from the `Your Character` menu, or the `Collections` tab on the sidebar. 

> [!NOTE]
> Collecting an avatar removes it from your inventory and cannot be uncollected.

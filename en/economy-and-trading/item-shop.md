# Item Shop

NPC shops have set prices and become available as you level. They often have cheaper prices than the player market, and you may buy up to 100 of a certain item at once. Since the V4.0 update, shops vary between towns. Some towns may lack shops entirely, and certain NPCs are exclusive to specific towns.

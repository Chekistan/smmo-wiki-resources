## Traveling

Traveling is the foundation of SimpleMMO, allowing you to make progress without being tied to any energy based system.

- Navigate to the `Travel` page by pressing the button at the middle of the navigation bar.
- Press `Take a Step` button to start your adventure. There's a chance to get gold, experience or items whenever you take a step.
- Youâ€™ll see various monsters you can fight, or trees, ores and more you can gather depending on your current location.
- More `Locations` open as your character progresses through the game.

Simple, isn't it?

**Pro Tip:** Explore new locations to discover different resources and new monsters.

## Battle

Engaging in battle in SimpleMMO starts with generating an enemy. Keep in mind each generated enemy costs `1 Energy Point`.

- To start, navigate to the `Battle Page` by pressing the button `Battle` at the right of the navigation bar.
- Click `Battle NPC` and then `Generate a new enemy`. Then press `Generate` to generate an opponent close to your level.
- Choose your opponent wisely, taking care not to engage with enemies out of your league, as enemies significantly stronger than your character may be impossible to defeat.
- Then press on `Battle` to initiate the fight.
- Click `Attack` to attack the opponent.

**Pro Tip:** Improve your strength by getting better gear or by getting a job.

## Quests

- To do a quest, navigate to the `Quests Page` by pressing the button `Quests` at the left of the navigation bar.
- Click on `Quest` you want to do. Then press `Perform Quest`.
- You get gold and experience for performing a quest.
- Quest has a chance to fail. The `Success Rate` is affected by `Dexterity`.
- Completing a quest increases your `Overall Bonus` from every quest by `0.5%`.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now mastered the basics of SimpleMMO. With just a few clicks, you can set your character on a path of adventure.
